# tutor-and-book-sharing

The basic idea behind the tutor-and-book-sharing application is to have both materially and experiance rich center of learning(platform) for children who are seeking a private tutor individually. plus it helps both the parents and tutors by communicating them easly. First,the  tutors have to apply for the admin and get account and once approved, their service(what they will provide for tutorial seeker) wil be available on the app. In this app children(their parent) could get access to search for the most feasible tutor (in terms of adress, subject, fee, experiance, ... )  and apply there. An application form needs to fill a form and submit. Once done, this form will be redirected to the tutors board/class to whom it submitetd.  So, one tutor will provide a help to more than one children provided they can go together. Admin and toturs will upload books and other material so that the system will become more powerful through time.
At the end, we will  have a big size system with many experianced tutorial providers and equally many users.
